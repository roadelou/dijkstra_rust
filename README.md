# Dijkstra (Rust)

This repository contains a minimal implementation I made of Dijkstra's algorithm in Rust. I have basically the same impression as with the other projects I wrote: __the result is nice, I just wish it didn't take me 4 hours to write it...__

Also I tried using `&str` instead of `String` in this repository because I thought they might be a bit simpler to handle. A few dozens lifetime annotations later, it is safe to say I was wrong :laughing:
