# Dijkstra (Rust)

This repository contains a basic implementation I made of Dijkstra's algorithm in Rust. I have basically the same impression as with the other projects I wrote: the result is nice, but it took 4 hours to write...

Also I tried using `&str` instead of `String` in this repository because I thought they might be a bit simpler to handle. A few dozens lifetime annotations later, it is safe to say I was wrong :laugh:
